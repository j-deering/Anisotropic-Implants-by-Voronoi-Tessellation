Selective Voronoi Tessellation as a Method to Design Anisotropic and Biomimetic Implants

This repository contains files associated with the manuscript "Selective Voronoi Tessellation as a Method to Design 
Anisotropic and Biomimetic Implants" by J. Deering et al. Sample workflows for seed redistribution and tessellation
are provided with varying levels of anisotropy for a 6mm x 6mm x 6mm cubic geometry with an interconnected pore network.
The Isotropic files correspond to a standard form of Voronoi tessellation in this geometry. Sample STL outputs are also
provided for each Grasshopper script. Note that the .gh files are best integrated into Rhino 6 modelling software.
